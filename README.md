# HND-VG-PROJECT-2
### High-Low Card
### Required Language: C or C++
## Description:

when playing, the player will be show a random number between 1 and 13, they will then be asked to decide whether the next number will be "higher" or "lower", If they guess correct the player is awarded with a 'cash' price and the game continues, if they guess incorrectly then the game comes to an end.

## User Stories:

1. As a user I would like the game to be easy to play
2. As a user I would like to be rewarded when I guess correctly
3. As a user I should be able to input my choice
4. As a user I would like to know how much money I made before the game ends
5. As a user I would like the game to end when I lose

# Design Documentation:
## Process of Implementation
We started the project by making the program select a random number between 1-13. Once we were able to get the system to select a random number we would then be able to set that to the first card. Once we had assigned the random number to the first card, we would then assign a random number to a second card, this would be the card that the player would need to guess for. Once the second card was shown we needed to make it so the player would recieve a reward for getting it right we did this by increasing the players cash each time they got the answer right, then when they finally get the answer wrong they will be shown their balance.
## IDE used and Features
The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that was used was Repl.it. It allows the user to test the code as well as give basic debugging features. It also gives the coder a visual representation of their code to the right. this helps the user to quickly see changes and problems with the code.
## Debugging Process
With 'repl.it' our debugging improved as we were able to see a live preview as well as get valid debugging messages to tell us where we made mistakes.
## Coding Standards
During the coding process, I made sure to constantly indent my code often so that I was able to identify the breaks in commands or even functions. it also means you donâ€™t have to press space a lot to get the same affect.
## Evaluation
Overall I feel that this being my second project it went very well. I felt that i was able to identify problems with my code and identify steps that i needed to take to finalize the code. Overall i feel that i was able to develop my skills whilst building this application. The Source code itself i feel is good, compared to my first project i added some simple comments to help me remember some parts of the code that i still did not fully understand.
