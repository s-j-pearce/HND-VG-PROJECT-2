# HND-VG-PROJECT-2
## Description:

when playing, the player will be show a random number between 1 and 13, they will then be asked to decide whether the next number will be "higher" or "lower", If they guess correct the player is awarded with a 'cash' price and the game continues, if they guess incorrectly then the game comes to an end.

## User Stories:

* As a user I would like the game to be easy to play
* As a user I would like to be rewarded when I guess correctly
* As a user I should be able to input my choice
* As a user I would like to know how much money I made before the game ends
* As a user I would like the game to end when I lose
