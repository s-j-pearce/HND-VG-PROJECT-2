### High-Low Card
## Description:

when playing, the player will be show a random number between 1 and 13, they will then be asked to decide whether the next number will be "higher" or "lower", If they guess correct the player is awarded with a 'cash' price and the game continues, if they guess incorrectly then the game comes to an end.

## User Stories:

1. As a user I would like the game to be easy to play
2. As a user I would like to be rewarded when I guess correctly
3. As a user I should be able to input my choice
4. As a user I would like to know how much money I made before the game ends
5. As a user I would like the game to end when I lose
